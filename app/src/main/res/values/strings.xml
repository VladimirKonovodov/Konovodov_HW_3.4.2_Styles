            The Captive\n
            A captive, alone in a dungeon I dwell,\n
            Entombed in the stillness and murk of a cell.\n
            Outside, in the courtyard, in wild, frenzied play,\n
            My comrade, an eagle, has pounced on his prey.\n
            Translated by I.Zheleznova.
